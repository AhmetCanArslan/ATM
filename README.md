# ATM

Automated teller machine built by windows forms. 
It has data control modules. You can create user, sign in, sign out, get cash or deposit money into your account. It saves the informations on the data.txt file. Sql can be used but i chose this way to practise windows form skills. This project consists of approximately 700 lines of code. 

You have to restart the program after ParaÇekme and ParaYatırma functions. Otherwise data will not be updated. It will be fixed
